# College-Scorecard-Visual
This is my (Yeng Miller-Chang's) first visualization using D3.js, uploaded 10/17/2017. Data are from the College Scorecard
data set available at <https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/>. This visual is an attempt to show in-state tuition prices 
from 2000-2016. 

This visual still needs to be refined. Namely, I will be working on building in zoom functionality so that the whole map does
not need to be shown.
